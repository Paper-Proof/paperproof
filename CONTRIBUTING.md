# Development

1. **Install the Paperproof vscode extension**

2. **Go to your vscode settings, and change your `Paperproof: Environment` setting to `"Development"`**

3. **Install dependencies**

    ```shell
    cd app; yarn install
    ```

3. **Start watching your changes**

    ```shell
    yarn server
    ```

    and, in a separate tab:

    ```shell
    yarn watch
    ```

That's it! You can check that everything works by going to `/Examples.lean`, and opening the Paperproof panel by clicking on a piece of a crumpled paper:

You can now change any piece of code within the `/app` folder, and the changes will be built automatically. To see those changes in the webview, you will need to run **Cmd+Shift+P "Developer: Reload Webviews"**.    
If you change some code in `/extension` folder, or in `/lean` folder, seeing the updates is more involved, and that's described in the next section.

# Reload

### Reloading `/app`

If you change something in the `/app` folder, wait for `yarn watch` to compile it, and run **Cmd+Shift+P** `> Developer: Reload Webviews`.

### Reloading `/extension`

If you change something in the `/extension` folder, run

```shell
cd extension
vsce package --out paperproof.vsix
code --uninstall-extension paperproof.paperproof || true
code --install-extension paperproof.vsix
```

and restart vscode (literally - quit it fully, and open it again).

> *ATTENTION: make sure you have yarn v1, otherwise you'll be getting errors from vsce (see [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-vsce/issues/517#issuecomment-874323151)).*

> *ATTENTION: if paperproof webview doesn't respond to `.postMessage(...)` calls, AND you have the OUTPUT pane open - close it, and it should start working. It's just some weird vscode glitch.*

### Reloading `/lean`

If you change something in the `/lean` folder, then go to the file where you're checking your code (usually it's `Examples.lean`), and run **Cmd+Shift+P** `> Lean 4: Refresh File Dependencies`.

# Publishing

Deploying our `main` branch consists of 2 steps - publishing a new vscode extension, and publishing a new Paperproof Lean library.

### Deploying `/app` and `/extension`

These folders get published together.  
To deploy them, you need to publish our vscode extension:

1. **Login into vsce**

    ```shell
    vsce login paperproof
    ```

    You will need the *Personal Access Token* for the paperproof organisation to do this (please ask Evgenia or Anton if you need access).

2. **Build and publish**

    ```shell
    vsce publish minor
    ```

    This will autoincrement the `/extension/package.json` version, and publish the Paperproof extension on [marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paperproof.paperproof](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paperproof.paperproof).  
    Possible increment options are `minor` (nearly always) and `major` (in exceptionally rare cases, only when Paperproof is entirely rewritten).

### Deploying `/lean`

To publish a new Paperproof Lean library, we just push to [github.com/Paper-Proof/paperproof](github.com/Paper-Proof/paperproof) `main` branch.  
The changes will be picked up automatically.

# Code structure

The easiest way to get up to speed with Paperproof's source code is to read [Paperproof Architecture](https://paperproof.brick.do/paperproof-s-architecture-P632P44ezDa9) blog post.  

The 3 folders you'll be working on is:
- `/lean` (parses the Lean proof structure),
- `/app` (contains all the frontend code that you see in the webview), and
- `/extension` (contains VSCode extension code).  

If you want to test the results of your changes, you can go to `Examples.lean`, or to `/_examples/...` for some more test cases.

# Version management

Like mentioned above, Paperproof VSCode extension and Paperproof Lean library are deployed separately; and, correspondingly, users download them separately.  
The **lean library version** and **vscode extension version** should be compatible.  

To ensure such compatibility, we have

- **lean library version**: `.version` field from `/lean/Paperproof.lean`, and
- **vscode extension version**: `desiredVersion` constant in `/app/indexBrowser.lean`

that must *exactly match*.  

If they don't match, we tell the user to update their **lean library version**.  
**Vscode extension version** is always ahead of the game, because VSCode automatically updates the extensions as soon as they are published.

___

There are some other mentions of versioning which have nothing to do with this matching:

- `GlobalContextType.UIVersion` - this is just how we determine when we should rerender the dependency arrows in the ui
- `/extension/package.json version` - this is automatically incremented when we publish vscode extension
- `/app/package.json version`, `/lean/lake-manifest.json version` - NOT USED
- `leanExtension.packageJSON.version` - we check the **vscode-lean4**'s extension version if connecting to their api errors out (this usually means **vscode-lean4** updated their api, and **paperproof** is not yet up to date)
